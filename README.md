# File-Extention-Tracker

built to create many shortcuts at once so it doesn't have to be manually done



* All previous bugs will be tracked here, and which ones are currently fixed (higher up the list = more recent)

with mass shortcut, it will put each shortcut with the target file (ignored)
would not work on fresh machine (fixed)
